Goerli Nethermind (Execution Client)
Goerli is ready for the merge!

There are now two APIs in the Geth Execution Client:

1. RPC API `http://nethermind-goerli.public.dappnode:8551`. Use this one to query transactions on your node and connect to your web3 wallet.
2. Engine API `http://nethermind-goerli.public.dappnode:8551`. Use this one to connect your Beacon Chain (Consensus Layer) client.

After the merge, if your Execution Client is not connected to a Consensus Layer client, you won't be able to use it to query the blockchain nor to connect it to your wallet!
